## What's this sh*t?

Well this is an api that i'm building with plans to integrate multiple api in itself. 
For now it integrates MongoDB and a simple REST API.
But let's say I want to create some Api to consume https://ipinfo.io/
Instead of creating a separate API project I simply create a new model for the data and setup some routes and everything needed for the API's to talk to each other.
In the future I intend to make this project compatible with a variety of database engines and multiple API.

## Why I created this project ?
Because I wanted and I can.

## How can you support me ? 

I don't need money. If you really want to help me simply help my code get better and send me you suggestions.
